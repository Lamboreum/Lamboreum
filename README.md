WTF is Lamboreum?
-------------
This is a coin "developed" aka "borrowed" code from another crypto Raptoreum, but forked off of Thooneum for the meme. This coin is created by The Mining Mersie. Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChyhUk16KJ6ehisnVDj8jRg. I made this because why not and it would be a cool learning experience I guess. **This is a MEME coin nothing more. Don't expect to make a profit out of this and if you do then congrats but if you loose money from this then skill issue. I am not liable for any losses that may occur.

Introduction
Lamboreum is a useless coin that has no meaning. However, hopefully one day we will all become magically rich from Elon Musk mentioning this coin so it can moon to get our Lambos.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing

Testing? what's that? Wen Lambo?

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
